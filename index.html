                <ol type="I"> <!-- Ordered list of interests -->
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how websites are built and structured. I'm interested in creating responsive, user-friendly sites that blend design and functionality, and I'm eager to learn both front-end and back-end development practices.</p>

                    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                    <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and daily life. I’m particularly drawn to machine learning and natural language processing, and how these technologies can be applied in education, automation, and scientific research.</p>

                    <li>Data Science</li>
                    <p>In today’s data-driven world, understanding how to collect, analyze, and visualize data is critical. I'm exploring how data science techniques can be used to extract insights, forecast trends, and solve real-world challenges in areas like healthcare, business, and development.</p>
                </ol>

            <!-- Section: Programming Languages -->
            <section id="programming-languages">
                <h2 class="programming-icon">Programming Languages</h2> <!-- Code icon shown before heading -->
                <p>I’m currently learning core programming languages that form the foundation of software and web development. These languages are helping me build a solid technical base as I grow into a full-stack developer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python</strong>: My first language for learning programming fundamentals such as variables, control flow, data structures, and functions. Python’s versatility makes it ideal for automation, data science, and AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong>: These form the structure and styling of web pages. I’m using them to create clean, responsive layouts and develop a strong understanding of page semantics, design, and user experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Section: Projects -->
            <section id="projects">
                <h2 class="projects-icon">Projects</h2> <!-- Presentation icon shown before heading -->
                <p>Although I’m still early in my journey, I’ve started working on beginner projects to reinforce what I’m learning and gain real-world coding experience. Each one represents a step forward in my development path:</p>
                <ul class="project-list"> <!-- List of projects -->
                    <li class="project"> <!-- Project 1 -->
                        <h3>Fun Calculator</h3>
                        <p>This is a Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also determine whether a number is odd, even, or prime. It was my first project and helped me understand Python syntax and logic building.</p>

                        <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
                        <p>This is the very website you’re browsing. I built it using HTML and CSS as a personal introduction and project showcase. It highlights my skills, interests, and background while also serving as a learning tool for building structured and styled content.</p>
