                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <p> I have always been interested in how websites are built and maintained, as well as how developers are able to incorporate complex animations, hyperlinks and traffic management to make their sites interactive and visually appealing.</p>
                    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                    <p> I am highly intrigued by the potential of AI to transform industries and improve our daily lives in general, whether it's assisting in learning of complex subject matter to assisting in the automation and monitoring of tedious industrial processes. I am particularly interested in machine learning and natural language processing, and the ways that they can be used to further scientific discovery.</p>
                    <li>Data Science</li>
                    <p> Data in the modern world is used as a powerful tool for decision-making and predictive analytics. I am intrigued by the ways data can be collected, analyzed, and visualized to uncover insights and drive innovation in untapped markets. I am eager to learn more about data science techniques and tools, and how they can be applied to real-world problems.</p>

                <p>As a novice programmer, I am currently learning the following programming languages in pursuit of becoming a fully-fledged Full-Stack Developer :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>HTML & CSS</li>

                <p>Since I'm a novice, I haven't really been able to complete any major projects yet. However, I intend on improving my skills and will hopefully have more here in the near future:</p>

                        <p>A fun calculator tool that can handle basic arithmetic operations ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as well as check if a value is an odd, even or prime number. This was built using Python, and is my first fun and basic bit of Python code.</p>
