# Samuel Waema's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as an introduction to who I am, my educational background, and my growing passion for technology — especially web development, artificial intelligence, and data science.


## 🌐 Project Overview

This portfolio is built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, showcasing a clean structure and a modern, rocket-themed dark design.  

It features:

- **Introduction & Profile Section** with clickable contact icons
- **Educational Background** with a downloadable CV
- **Interests** in tech fields like AI and Data Science
- **Programming Languages** currently being learned
- **Projects** with links to GitHub repositories
- **Contact Section** with email and a Google Forms link
- **Footer** for branding and copyright

It also includes updated section descriptions, improved grammar, and cleaner layout for better readability and professionalism. The navigation bar is styled horizontally and adapts for mobile screens.
