# Samuel Waema's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as an introduction to who I am, my educational background, and my growing passion for technology — especially web development, artificial intelligence, and data science.


## 🌐 Project Overview

This portfolio has been completely revamped with a modern, professional, and fully responsive design. Built with **HTML5** and advanced **CSS3**, it showcases a clean, stylish aesthetic suitable for a software developer's profile.

The design features:
- A professional dark theme with a navy blue and teal color palette.
- A card-based layout for projects and skills.
- A fully responsive structure that looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
